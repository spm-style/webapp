		<p>Copyright (c) 2017</p>

		<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
		of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

		<h4>Preamble</h4>

		<p>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
		Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
		The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic
		control over the development of that Package while still keeping the
		Package available as open source and free software.</p>

		<p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
		license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the
		terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to
		make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek
		a different licensing arrangement.</p>

		    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.</p>

		    <p>"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing
		    this Package or providing support for this Package to another
		    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.</p>

		    <p>"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been
		    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested
		    by the Copyright Holder.</p>

		    <p>"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and
		    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright
		    Holder.</p>

		    <p>"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with

		<h4>Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution</h4>

		<ol class="start">
			<li>You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
		Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that
		you do not Distribute the Modified Version.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version</h4>

		<ol class="continue">
			<li>You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the
		Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,
		either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate
		all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At
		your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a
		Compiled form of the Package.</li>
			<li>You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
		modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting
		Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such
		will be subject to the Original License.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source</h4>

		<ol class="continue">
			<li>You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis
		or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the
		Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs
		from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting
		any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that
		you do at least ONE of the following
				<ol type="a">
					<li>make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder
				    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the
				    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard
				    Version.
				  </li>
				  <li>ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not
		    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In
		    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
		    from the name of the Standard Version.
		    	</li>
				  <li>allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
		    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others
		    under:
		    		<ol>
		    			<li>the Original License or</li>
		    			<li>a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
		        modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
		        licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
		        received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
		        Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
		        available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
		        Fees are allowed.</li>
		    		</ol>
		    	</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source</h4>

		<ol class="continue">
			<li>You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
		the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
		get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
		valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
		time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
		must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
		If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
		days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
		you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.</li>
			<li>You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
		the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
		the Source of the Modified Version.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Aggregating or Linking the Package</h4>

		<ol class="continue">
			<li>You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
		Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
		aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
		Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
		components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
		apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
		as included in the aggregation.</li>
			<li>You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
		other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
		build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
		include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
		provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version</p>
		<ol class="continue">
			<li>Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
		merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
		the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
		considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
		terms of this license.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>General Provisions</h4>

		<ol class="continue">
			<li>Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
		Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
		modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
		use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
		license.</li>
			<li>If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified
		Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required
		to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of
		this license.</li>
			<li>This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
		service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.</li>

		(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
		that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent
		infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the
		date that such litigation is filed.</li>

		<h2>Free to use spm services</h2>

		<p>spm Open Source terms of use (these Terms) govern access to and use of https://www.{{ domaine }} (the Website) as well as the "spm Public Registry" at https://api.{{ domaine }} (the Public Registry). Both the Website and the Public Registry are operated by SPM (spm). The Website and the Public Registry are referred to together as spm Open Source throughout these Terms.</p>

		<p>These spm Open Source Terms were created on November, 2017.</p>

		<h3>Important Terms</h3>

		<p>These Terms include a number of important provisions that affect your rights and responsibilities, such as the disclaimers in "Disclaimers", limits on spm's liability to you in "Limits on Liability", and an agreement to arbitrate disputes individually in "Arbitration".</p>

		<h3>Other Terms</h3>

		<p>As there is no additional, paid service, yet, there is no additional term.</p>

		<h3>Legal Agreement</h3>

		<p>You may only access or use spm Services by agreeing to these Terms. If spm adds any additional functionality to spm Services, you must agree to these Terms to use new features, too. You show your agreement with spm on these Terms by by creating a user account (your Account) or by accessing or using spm Services without creating an account. The agreement between you and spm is a legally binding contract (this Agreement).</p>

		<h3>Changes</h3>

		<p>spm may change these Terms and the additional terms for Paid Services in the future. spm will post changes on the Website with a new "last updated" date. If you have an Account, spm will notify you of changes by email to the address provided for your Account, by a message on the Website, or both. If you do not have an account, spm may notify you of changes by a general announcement via the Website, but it is up to you to check for changes to these Terms. After receiving notice of changes to these Terms, you must accept those changes to continue using spm Services. You accept changes to these Terms by continuing to use spm Services. spm may change, suspend, or discontinue spm Services at any time without notice or liability to you.</p>

		<h3>spm Policies</h3>

		<h4>Privacy policy</h4>

		<p>spm's privacy policy can be found at https://www.{{ domaine }}/privacy.</p>

		<h4>Code of conduct</h4>

		<p>spm's code of conduct can be found at https://www.{{ domaine }}/code-of-conduct.</p>

		<h2>Trademark</h2>

		<p>This policy describes spm trademarks and how you may use them. For information on what to do if someone infringes a trademark of yours with a confusing package name, see the Dispute Resolution Policy.</p>

		<h3>What is spm ?</h3>

		<p>spm is a style project manager. It was created in 2017 by Hervé Ehrhart and Adrien Guémy as an open source project to help developers and designers share modules (aka packages) of code in a very easy and efficient way.</p>

		<p>The spm project contains two main parts:<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The spm client, which is bundled with the Node.js platform, and is used as a command line tool to install and publish packages. It is simply called "spm". Its code is available as an open-source project: https://github.com/spm-style/cli</li>
				<li>The spm registry service. When a user of the spm client runs the command spm install example-package, the spm client retrieves the package and all related dependencies from the spm registry service. The example output looks like this:
		user1-MacBook-Pro-2:~ user1$ spm install example-package
		spm http GET https://api.{{ domaine }}/example-package
		spm http 200 https://api.{{ domaine }}/example-package
		example-package@2.4.1 node_modules/example-package
		The registry is run as a free public service for anyone wanting to publish an open source package and for anyone to install an open source package.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>What is SPM and what is its mission statement ?</h3>

		<p>spm is an association co-founded by spm's creator Hervé Ehrhart and Adrien Guémy.</p>

		<p>SPM is dedicated to the long term success of the front and front-end community, which includes the success of the open-source Node.js and spm projects.</p>

		<p>At SPM we do three things to support this goal:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Run the open source registry as a free service.</li>
			<li>Build tools and operate services that support the secure use of packages in a private or enterprise context.</li>
			<li>Build innovative new tools and services for the developer community.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Why SPM has a trademark policy</h3>

		<p>SPM has filed for trademarks for the spm name and logo. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>We'd like to make it easy for anyone to use the spm name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve spm.</li>
			<li>We'd like to make it clear how spm-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the spm name and logo.</li>
			<li>We'd like to make it hard for anyone to use the spm name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick, or confuse people who are looking for official spm resources.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Nominative use - No need to type ™ on twitter</h3>

		<p>It's perfectly OK to use "spm" to refer to SPM, to the spm software, and to the spm public registry. That's different from using spm in the name of one's own product or service.</p>

		<p>Nominative use means it's OK to refer to something that is trademarked, but it is not OK to incorporate one association's trademark into another company's product, service, or company name. That's why you would need permission from the trademark owner to open "Discount Nike Shoes" or "iPad App Marketplace".</p>

		<h3>The spm trademark policy</h3>

		<p>We ask that you get permission from SPM to use the spm name or logo as part of the name of any project, product, service, domain or company.</p>

		<p>We will grant permission to use the spm name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the spm client software or the spm registry service.</li>
			<li>Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).</li>
			<li>Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the Artistic License 2.0 under which spm is distributed, or which are in violation of this trademark policy.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>For other projects, we have set up the following rules around the use of the spm trademark:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>It is not OK use spm in the name of any product, service, or project, except after the preposition "for". For example, "Private Registry Hosting for spm". * You should not use spm in a company or domain name for a package registry or related service without our permission.</li>
			<li>When referring to the spm software in body text, the first usage should be followed by a generic term such as "package manager" to provide context. spm should never be used or explained as an acronym.</li>
			<li>When referring to the spm public registry, please follow spm with the word "registry" or the phrase "public registry".</li>
			<li>When referring to a private registry for spm packages, please describe it as "private registry for spm packages" or as a spm-registry proxy when first referring to it in the text.</li>
			<li>References to the owner of the spm client software and the operator of the spm public registry should be to SPM</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Any materials referring to spm should include the following notice in the fine print: "spm is a trademark of SPM"<br>Examples of ways to use the term "spm" in a name</p>

		<p>&#60;Your consulting co's> services for spm<br>
		e.g. Pink Unicorn Consulting Ltd. services for spm</p>

		<p>&#60;Your software co's> private registry for spm<br>
		e.g. Purple Unicorn Inc. private registry server for spm<br>
		An example of a way to refer to spm when describing your solution:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Paypal/Kappa, a hierarchical spm-registry proxy</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In the case of Kappa, it is clear that the open source project name is "Kappa" so no one would be reasonably confused that it is the official spm client, or the official spm registry.</p>

		<p>Explaining that something is a proxy of the spm registry is OK.</p>

		<p>When in doubt about your use of the spm name or logo, please contact SPM for clarification.</p>

		<h3>The spm Logo and Axolotl mascot</h3>

		<p>Our spm Logo is very recognizable and deserves special treatment. The spm Logo signifies us, or a special relationship with us, and you should use it only with our permission. Since the goal is to avoid confusion about you being us, or your relationship with us, context counts. We will consider requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>

		<p>Like the spm Logo, the spm Axolotl graphic is a very recognizable part of the spm brand, and signifies a special relationship with the the spm project, service, or company. It should never be used except with explicit written permission. We will consider requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>

		<p>Please be advised that, unlike the spm logo, the Axolotl generally may not be used to refer to the project, service, or company in a nominative sense, as any usage will almost always imply a special relationship with spm.</p>

		<h2>Use of spm Open Source</h2>

		<p>Subject to these Terms, spm grants you permission to use spm Open Source. That permission is not exclusive to you, and you cannot transfer it to anyone else.</p>

		<p>Your permission to use spm Open Source entitles you to do the following:</p>
		* You may search for, download, publish, and manage packages of computer code (Packages) in the Public Registry, and otherwise interact with the Public Registry, via the command-line tool published by spm at https://www.github.com/spm/spm (the CLI).
		* You may search for, download, publish, and manage Packages using software other than CLI via application programming interfaces that spm publicly documents or makes available for public use (Public APIs).
		* You may search for and manage Packages in the Public Registry, and otherwise interact with the Public Registry, via the Website.
		* You may update and manage your Account via the Website.

		<h3>Conditions</h3>

		<p>Your permission to use spm Open Source, as well as any permission you may have to use Paid Services, are subject to the following conditions:</p>

		<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use spm Services.</p>

		<p>You may not use spm Services after spm says you may not, such as by disabling your Account.</p>

		<p>You must use spm Services only in accordance with "Acceptable Use".</p>

		<h3>Acceptable Use</h3>

		<p>You will abide by the Code of Conduct and the Dispute Policy.</p>

		<p>You will not submit material to spm as a package or in any other form that violates spm's Acceptable Content, described below.</p>

		<p>You will not disclose information that you do not have the right to disclose, such as confidential information of others.</p>

		<p>You will not copy or share any personally identifiable information of any other person without their specific permission.</p>

		<p>You will not violate any applicable law.</p>

		<p>You will not use or attempt to use another person's Account without their specific permission.</p>

		<p>You will not buy, sell, or otherwise trade in user names, organization names, names for Packages, or any other names reserved on spm Services, for money or other compensation.</p>

		<p>You will not send advertisements, chain letters, or other solicitations via spm Services.</p>

		<p>You will not automate access to, use, or monitor the Website, such as with a web crawler, browser plug-in or add-on, or other computer program that is not a web browser. You may replicate data from the Public Registry using the Public APIs per this Agreement.</p>

		<p>You will not use spm Services to send email to distribution lists, newsgroups, or group mail aliases.</p>

		<p>You will not falsely imply that you are affiliated with or endorsed by spm.</p>

		<p>You will not operate illegal schemes, such as pyramid schemes, via spm Services.</p>

		<p>You will not deep-hyperlink to images or other non-hypertext content served by spm Services.</p>

		<p>You will not remove any marking indicating proprietary ownership from any material got via spm Services.</p>

		<p>You will not display any portion of the Website via an HTML IFRAME.</p>

		<p>You will not disable, avoid, or circumvent any security or access restrictions of spm Services, or access parts of spm Services not intended for access by you.</p>

		<p>You will not strain infrastructure of spm Services with an unreasonable volume of requests, or requests designed to impose an unreasonable load on IT systems underlying spm Services.</p>

		<p>You will not encourage or assist any other person in violation of "Acceptable Use".</p>

		<h3>Acceptable Content</h3>

		<p>Administrators at spm reserve the right to delete content hosted on the spm Services that is deemed unacceptable. Unacceptable content can take the form of a package, a README file, a user or organization name, or any other content submitted to the spm Services. Content that is unacceptable includes but is not limited to:</p>

		<p>Content that is illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. This includes content that is harassing, inappropriate or abusive.</p>

		<p>Content in violation of law, infringing the intellectual property rights of others, violating the privacy or other rights of others, or in violation of any agreement with a third party. This includes code which violates a license.</p>

		<p>Content containing malicious computer code, such as computer viruses, computer worms, rootkits, back doors, adware, or spyware. This includes content submitted for research purposes unless agreed to in advance by spm. Tools designed and documented explicitly to assist in security research are acceptable, but proof-of-concept exploits are not.</p>

		<p>Packages that are not functionally compatible with the spm command-line client. For example, a "package" cannot simply be a PNG or JPEG image, a movie file, or a text document uploaded directly to the registry. Using the Public Registry as a general purpose database is not allowed.</p>

		<p>Content that exists only to "reserve" a name, whether a package name, user name, or organization name, i.e. "squatting". The previous Abuse section governs how spm handles cases of squatting.</p>

		<h3>Enforcement of Acceptable Use</h3>

		<p>spm may investigate and prosecute violations of this Agreement to the fullest legal extent. spm may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of this Agreement.</p>

		<h3>Your Account</h3>

		<p>You must create and log into an Account to access features of some spm Services, including spm Open Source.</p>

		<p>To create an Account, you must provide certain information about yourself, as required by the account creation form on the Website or the CLI. If you create an Account, you will provide, at a minimum, a valid email address. You will keep that email address up-to-date. You will not impersonate any other individual. You may delete your Account at any time by sending an email to support@{{ domaine }}.</p>

		<p>You will be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or give spm notice that the security of your Account has been compromised. You will notify spm immediately if you suspect the security of your Account has been compromised. You will select a secure password for your Account. You will keep your password secret.</p>

		<p>spm may restrict, suspend, or terminate your Account according to this policy if spm reasonably believes that you are in breach of these Terms or if spm reasonably believes that you have misused spm Services.</p>

		<h3>Your Content</h3>

		<p>Nothing in this Agreement gives spm any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with spm Services, such as your Account information or any Packages you share with spm Services (Your Content). Nothing in this Agreement gives you any ownership rights in spm intellectual property provided via spm Services, like software, documentation, trademarks, service marks, logotypes, or other distinguishing graphics.</p>

		<p>Between you and spm, you remain solely responsible for Your Content. You will not wrongly imply that Your Content is sponsored or approved by spm. spm will not be obligated to store, maintain, or provide copies of your content, except per the Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p>spm may remove Your Content from spm Services without notice if spm suspects Your Content was submitted or used in violation of "Acceptable Use", as well as per the Copyright Policy.</p>

		<p>Your Content belongs to you. You decide whether and how to license it. But at a minimum, you license spm to provide Your Content to users of spm Services when you share Your Content. That special license allows spm to copy, publish, and analyze Your Content, and to share its analyses with others. spm may run computer code in Your Content to analyze it, but spm's special license alone does not give spm the right to run code for its functionality in spm products or services.</p>

		<p>When Your Content is removed from the Website or the Public Registry, whether by you or spm, spm's special license ends when the last copy disappears from spm's backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses, such as open source licenses, may continue after Your Content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or spm itself, the right to share Your Content with spm Services again.</p>

		<p>Others who receive Your Content via spm Services may violate the terms on which you license Your Content. You agree that spm will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>

		<h2>Feedback</h2>

		<p>spm welcomes your feedback and suggestions for spm Services. You agree that spm will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide without further notice, consent, or payment. You will not submit feedback or suggestions that you consider confidential or proprietary.</p>

		<h2>Indemnity</h2>

		<p>You will indemnify spm, its officers, directors, employees, representatives, and agents, and hold them harmless for, all liability, expenses, damages, and costs from any third-party claims, demands, lawsuits, or other proceedings alleging that Your Content, your use of spm Services, or both, violate the intellectual property right of a third party, this Agreement, or applicable law. You will not settle any such proceeding without the prior written consent of spm. spm will notify you of any such proceeding it becomes aware of.</p>

		<h2>Disclaimers</h2>

		<p>Use of spm Services is at your sole risk. spm Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. spm expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of title, noninfringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

		<p>spm makes no warranty that spm Services will meet your requirements, operate in an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free manner, or that errors in spm Services will be corrected.</p>

		<p>You receive material via spm Services at your sole risk. You will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system and network, as well as any data loss that may result from use of spm Services or material received via spm Services.</p>

		<p>spm Services may provide information and software that is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. spm may, but does not promise to, review content provided by spm Services.</p>

		<p>spm Services provide information about ownership and licensing of Packages, as provided by those Packages' publishers. That information may be wrong. spm cannot and does not provide legal advice.</p>

		<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

		<p>spm Services may hyperlink to and integrate with third-party applications, websites, and other services. You decide whether and how to use and interact with such services. spm does not make any warranty regarding such services or content they may provide, and will not be liable to you for any damages related to such services. Use of such third-party services may be governed by other terms and privacy notices that are not part of this Agreement and are not controlled by spm.</p>

		<h2>Limits on Liability</h2>

		<p>Neither spm nor any third-party service provider used by spm to provide spm Services will, under any circumstances, be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages related to your use of spm Services or this Agreement, whether based on breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort (including negligence, product liability, or otherwise), or any other pecuniary loss, and whether or not spm has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
