		<doc-info-list type="important" title="spm is based on 3 different elements:">
			<doc-info-list-item><doc-highlight>modules</doc-highlight>, which bring customizable components into your code</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item><doc-highlight>projects</doc-highlight>, bringing powerful enterprise features on the top of modules</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item><doc-highlight>styleguides</doc-highlight>, defining your modules' or projects' style and best practices</doc-info-list-item>
		</doc-info-list>
		<doc-description>Each element can be shared publicly or privately with a selected community, accessible through spm's registry.</doc-description>
		<doc-description>Once an element has been published, it is available on our sandbox platform, where it can be customized and its source code downloaded.</doc-description>
		<doc-description>It will as well be available to be used from anyone having access, from anywhere.</doc-description>

  	<doc-description>spm stylesheets are powered by <doc-extra-link link="http://sass-lang.com/">scss</doc-extra-link>, the most popular css preprocessing language. They are designed to work with css and scss for now.</doc-description>
		<doc-description>The elements' dynamic part are powered by javascript, allowing ES5 and ES6 versions (<doc-extra-link link="https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module">until modular scripts are fully supported by browsers</doc-extra-link>).</doc-description>
		<doc-description>Before we dive into our core feature, modules, let's talk a bit more what they are:</doc-description>
		<doc-info-list type="important" title="Each module can contain:">
			<doc-info-list-item>one or several stylesheets to affect the classes used in the DOM</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item>a script defining a javascript class</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item>high-level style or script variables used to customize the graphical behaviour of the component</doc-info-list-item>
		</doc-info-list>
		<doc-description>A module's full name is made up with the initial author's name and the intial module name, joined by a <doc-highlight>_</doc-highlight>. Classes and variables used to customize the module will originally always start with the module's full name.</doc-description>
		<doc-info-list type="important" title="You will find in a module distinct elements:">
			<doc-info-list-item><doc-highlight>module-spm.json</doc-highlight> file containing the module information, especially the entry file where all the code is imported</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item><doc-highlight>variables-spm.scss</doc-highlight> file containing the module's main variables and especially the variable you can customize</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item><doc-highlight>spm_modules</doc-highlight> folder, where all your project's modules are stored</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item><doc-highlight>spm_instances</doc-highlight> folder, where two files are stored: <doc-highlight>spm_instances.js</doc-highlight> and <doc-highlight>spm_instances.scss</doc-highlight>. They're used to list, select and customize all the modules' scripts and stylesheets you're using in your code</doc-info-list-item>
			<doc-info-list-item>three entry files for your html, css and javascript code, generally named after your module</doc-info-list-item>
		</doc-info-list>
		<doc-description>Every time you use spm CLI commands, it locates spm scope by finding the closest module-spm.json file, in the current directory or its parents. You will be able to store modules inside each of your project or in your root as a global registry.</doc-description>
		<doc-description>When installing spm, a registry is created as well. Global modules will be stored in it, classified by names, then by version.</doc-description>
		<doc-description>Once you've found a module you like, you're ready to deploy it in your project!</doc-description>
